the application of machine learning models in chemistry has made remarkable strides in recent years. While the field of analytical chemistry has also received considerable interest from machine learning practitioners, very few models have been adopted into everyday use. Among the analytical instruments available to chemists, Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is one of the cheapest, easiest and most accessible. So far the use of IR has been limited to the identification of a select few functional groups with well-known vibrational frequencies with the interpretation of most peaks lying outside of human capabilities.
