Paper collection about IR to molecule

Machine learning has significantly advanced the application of chemistry in recent years. Despite growing interest from machine learning experts, the adoption of these models into routine use in analytical chemistry remains limited. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, one of the most cost-effective, straightforward, and widely accessible analytical tools for chemists, has primarily been used to identify specific functional groups with known vibrational frequencies. However, interpreting the majority of IR spectroscopy peaks still exceeds human capabilities.

Machine learning, particularly in the realm of language modeling, has demonstrated significant potential in chemistry. These models are applied across various tasks, from predicting retrosynthetic pathways and designing new drug candidates to facilitating the automation of experimental processes. In the area of IR spectroscopy, machine learning has further enhanced the analysis and processing of spectral data.
